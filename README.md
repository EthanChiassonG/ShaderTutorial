# ShaderTutorial

This collection is the shaders that we were asked to mimic in class. 

The Tutorial shader one samples a base texture, multiplies it by a color tint and a brightness scalar
The Fresnel calculates how much of the surface is visible at grazing angles and adds a rim highlight, making light come from everywhere but where the camera is facing 
Environmental Cubemap reflection is what it says on the tin, reflects a cube map on a metalic surface through reflecting the camera views vectors
Lambers is basically just a Remade version of normal diffuse lighting

Honestly I really liked this exercise, this really widened my eyes on the possiblities on what shaders can be used for, I was using the Fresnel one on a sawblade asset i made for a modeling class and it honestly looked incredible, I may try to re-create this at some point for some of my other projects
For things i struggled with, the inital assembly did take quite a while, I've never used shader files before and it was a bit of a learning curve getting used to the unqiue working and language but once i got the hang of it, it started to come together.
